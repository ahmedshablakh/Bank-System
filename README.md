# Bank System Project in C++ Using OOP

This is a fully functional bank management system developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
The project provides a secure and efficient system to manage banking operations such as adding, editing, and deleting customers and users, transferring balances, and providing login interfaces for authorized users.

# Features
Add Customers:
Ability to register new customers in the system.
Store essential customer data in an organized and secure manner.
Edit Customers and Users:

Modify details of existing customers or users easily.
Update records instantly within the system.
Delete Customers and Users:

Remove inactive or unnecessary customers or users from the system.
Ensure safe deletion without affecting other operations.
Balance Transfers:

Support for transferring funds between customers within the system.
Record all financial transactions to ensure transparency.
Login System:

User login interface with username and password authentication.
Manage access for authorized users only.
Password Encryption:

Simple encryption algorithm to protect user passwords.
Support for High-Volume Operations:

Efficiently handle a large number of operations concurrently without performance degradation.
#  Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Designed classes to represent core entities like customers, accounts, and transactions.
Encryption Algorithms:
Implemented a basic encryption method for password security.
How to Run
Download the source code from GitHub Repository.
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
Run the project using the following command:
bash 
g++ -o bank_system main.cpp && ./bank_system

# Future Enhancements
Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.
Use a database for managing customer data instead of text files.
Improve the encryption algorithm for enhanced security.
Add multi-language support to expand the user base.
